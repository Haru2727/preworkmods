<h2>BIO</h2>
<p>Outkast is a rap group based out of Atlanta.  It was fomred by two highschool friends.  They may have met in school but they were quick to <br> 
leave in order to chase their dreams of becoming the best rappers in the city.  Soon after linking up with the Dungeon Family Outkast was on its way <br>
to becoming a household name.  After their first album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik it put Atlanta on the map as a future center of hip-hop.
